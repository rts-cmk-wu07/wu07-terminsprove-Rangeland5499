# Project Title

### Trainer app
## About the Project:
The Trainer mobile app gets some data about the available classes with some details from the [Trainer API](http://localhost:4000) as backend.
In the app, people can log in as users. After login there is a sign up button with the option to leave the classes. 
There is also a page that shows the classes that the user has selected, with the date and time.

## Technologies
- ##### HTML
- ##### CSS
- ##### JavaScript

### Framework

- ##### React :
The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook.

### Libraries 
- ##### TailwindCSS : 
Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

- ##### React Router :
React Router is the most popular routing library in React. Routing is a process in which a user is directed to different pages based on their action or request.

- ##### React icons :
React icons is a great resource for React developers, who can use its customizable SVG icons in their applications.

- #### React rating :
The React Rating UI component allows users to leave a rating in a digestible, visual way.

- #### React multi carousel :

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
